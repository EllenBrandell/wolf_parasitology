# About
Gray wolf scats were collected in Yellowstone National Park from 2018-2020 and three laboratory analyses were performed:
1. wolf genotyping,
2. cestode ('parasite') identification and species ID, and
3. endocrinology, i.e., measurement of fecal glucocorticoid levels.

Our goals were three-fold: (1) Identify the cestodes infecting Yellowstone wolves; (2) Examine how noninvasively-collected wolf samples were affected by environmental conditions with respect to the success of wolf genotyping; (3) Assess the relationship between wolf biological and social characteristics and parasite infections. Analyses for goals 2 and 3 are in this repository.

## Collaborators
This project is a collaborative effort including researchers from the National Park Service, Penn State University, USGS, and USDA. These analyses will contribute to a manuscript in preparation for peer review. Please contact Ellen Brandell for futher information.

# Genotype success model
Noninvasive genetic methods are a growing field and may provide a safer, cheaper, and easier way to monitor wildlife populations. The goal of this model is to better understand how environmental conditions impact the probability that a scat is successfully genotyped.

# Cestode model
The goal of this model is to explain associations between
